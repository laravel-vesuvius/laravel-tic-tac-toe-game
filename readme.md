# Tic-tac-toe

Tic-tac-toe game on Laravel

## About the game

### The game has 2 Interfaces

- WEB-interface is built using HTML/CSS for the browser game. It works by reloading the pages on HTML forms, without Javascript. To start a game the user needs to click the “Start game” button on the main page. The user has ability to continue playing on another device by copying the link of the current page. Before making the moves, the player and his opponent have to fill in his names accordingly.

- JSON-API-interface is created to rule the game via the third-party programs (for example, mobile app). In the mobile app you can do all the same actions as in the browser version.
